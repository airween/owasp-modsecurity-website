Yes! As a project in order to support activities like summits, hackathons, and speaking at conferences we need sponsors. 
If you appreciate the work we do, or you use it heavily, you should consider sponsoring. If you are interested, please get 
in touch with ModSecurity Co-Leaders via modsecurity /at/ owasp.org. They are in charge of sponsoring contacts.
