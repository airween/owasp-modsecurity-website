We rule out any sharing of your data with anybody outside our project.

### How do we store your data?

Our site securely stores your IP address in `access_log` files (this log is destroyed after 28 days). Your anonymized IP address and browser information are stored long-term in a self-hosted Matomo database.

The right to access - You have the right to request copies of your personal data. We may charge you a fee for this service.

The right to erasure - You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.

If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <modsecurity@owasp.org>.

### How do we use cookies?

Our project uses cookies to understand how our users use our website. We use it to focus our resources on the most important content, keeping in mind the popular browsers and devices used by our visitors.

### Subprocessors

### How to contact us?

That is our priority. But feel free to contact us and we'll make sure we have a response for you in due time.

Please email us at <modsecurity@owasp.org>.
