When the transfer of control took place at the end of January, the interim management stated that they wanted a one-on-one meeting with developers interested in maintaining ModSecurity. It's time. Please save the date: we would like to organize a mini-event on June 5, 2024, where we can meet everyone in person and discuss future tasks. The venue is Leuven, Belgium - the exact location has yet to be determined. We will meet around 13:00 and will leave about 18:00. Stay tuned, register on [Slack](https://owasp.slack.com), where we will try to answer all your questions on the #project-modsecurity channel.
