We would like to share information about the published CVE with id CVE-2024-46292.

<!--more-->

On September 12 we received an email to modsecurity@owasp.org. The subject was "Modsecurity 3.0.12 Dos Issue". Here are some brief summary about our conversation:

* 12:27 CEST: The sender shared with us only the link which also exists in CVE.
* 14:00 CEST: We tried to clarify some questionable details and asked the reporter in email
* 16:36 CEST: The reporter answered briefly. He wrote that he was able to DoS the engine with version 3.0.12 and CRS 4.1, but was not able with CRS 3.2. He also mentioned that with ModSecurity 3.0.4 he wasn't reproduce the behavior at all (neither with CRS 4.1 nor 3.2)
* 17:14 CEST: In our response we draw his attention to the fact that if the phenomenon occurs only with a certain version of the rule, then the engine is probably not affected; even if he can't reproduce the behavior with a very old version of the engine, with both rule versions

We must add the fact that on September 12 he mentioned ModSecurity 3.0.12, but the version [3.0.13](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/releases/tag/v3.0.13) was released almost two weeks before, on September 03.

We also informed him that the presented attack is only possible if he increases the variable `SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit` to an extremely high value. In this case, we assume that everyone knows what they are doing and what risks do they take.

Despite the modified configuration, we still cannot reproduce the described behavior. Obviously we used the same parameters and versions.

Then on October 09 the CVE was published. We immediately contacted him and asked more information:

* why did he not inform us about the publication of the CVE?
  * he answered that he opened the CVE before he asked us and wrote that he _"didn't expect it to pass."_ and he _"only remembered to contact you after submitting."_
  * he also added for the DoS issue that he _"did not continue to verify it due to busy work"_, and he is _"not very familiar with the specific reasons"_.
* he didn't mention "buffer overflow" at all in our conversation
  * we asked him about this and he replied he does not know how did it get there (?)

We are still very happy with every announcement and we are happy to cooperate with anyone, but it would be great if anyone who wants to help to discover a bug, contact with us first. An amazing amount of time has passed to deal with this case.

Unfortunately we are still not able to reproduce the issue. If the reporter is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation of the essence of the notification, we will start the procedure to withdraw the CVE.
